                Sarpagandha is known to lower blood pressure by many mechanisms. Firstly, it causes dilatation of the blood vessels.

                parasympathetic activity. This results in decreased heart rate, strength of heart muscle contraction and tone of the blood vessels. Sarpagandha is especially useful in those cases where the blood pressure has aggravated due to excess sympathetic 
                nervous system activity such as in stress.</p>
