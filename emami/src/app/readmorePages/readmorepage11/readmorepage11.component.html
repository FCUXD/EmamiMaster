  <h3>Understanding erectile dysfunction   </h3>
  <p>Sexual wellness plays a crucial role in the life of every individual. Though discussing sex is considered a taboo, sexual health is as important as physical and mental health. In our modern fast-paced times, in addition to increasing prevalence of health problems such as diabetes or obesity, there is also an increasing incidence of sexual problems in both males and females.</p>
  <p>Some of the common sexual problems in males are erectile dysfunction1 and ejaculation problems.<sup>2,3</sup> Among females, it is the inability to reach orgasm, pain (dyspareunia), and failure of genital response due to poor lubrication. Varied treatment options are now available in both modern and Ayurvedic medicine, which are capable of completely curing sexual problems</p>
  <p>Erectile dysfunction is one of the most common sexual problems among males. Though it is not a serious health issue, it does cause severe stress, lowers self-confidence, and gives rise to problems in marital life. </p>
  <h3>What is Erectile Dysfunction? </h3>   
  <p>Erectile dysfunction refers to the failure to get erection and/or maintaining it till the end of ejaculation. It is also known as impotence.<sup>4</sup></p>
  <p>Erectile dysfunction may affect males of any age group, but is more common among those above the age of 40 years.<sup>4</sup> </p> 
<!-- <p id="kapha">Mutragranthi: Vata and pitta affect blood and produce a hard nodular mass in the opening of the urinary bladder, which makes urination difficult and painful.</p>
<p>Vatabasti: Suppressing the urge of urination leads to the vitiation of the vatadosha in bladder, resulting in the retention of urine along with distress and itching</p> -->
   <h3>Ayurvedic Approach to Erectile Dysfunction:  </h3>
  <p>Ayurvedic literature describes erectile Dysfunction as <span class="hbbold">Klaibya.</span> This is seen only in males.  The incident rate of this condition is higher in the present generation, owing to unhealthy eating habits, inactive lifestyle, and mental stress.<sup>2</sup></p>
  <p>Acharya Sushruta mentions Klaibya as aprharshamanandaabhavaha (lack of sexual arousal and happiness). In general, erectile dysfunction can be described as the persistent inability of the male to perform sexual activities due to a difficulty in getting an erection or a lack of ejaculation.</p>
  <!-- <p><span class="hbbold">Causes of Klaibya:</span></p> -->

   <h3 class="dysfunctions">Samprapti of Klaibya :<sup>6,7</sup> </h3>
   <p>There are four <span class="hbbold">different types of klaibya </span> according to Acharyas. They are explained as follows:</p>

    <h3 class="dysfunctions">•	DhvajabhangajaKlaibya: </h3>
    <p>Dhwaja in this context means penis and bhanga means change in the structure. Any change in the structure of the penis causes inflammatory changes and ulceration in the genital areas. This leads to pain and discomfort during intercourse. Gradually, the ulcer may penetrate the deeper tissues and destroy the blood vessels, muscles and nerves present in the male genitalia, leading to a permanent erectile dysfunction.</p>

    <h3 class="dysfunctions">•	BijopaghatajaKlaibya: </h3>
    <p>According to Chakrapani, factors like consuming dry or incompatible food, excessive food intake, excessive physical activity, sorrow or grief cause an aggravation of the vatadosha, and diminution of semen (Shukrakshaya). This may lead to erectile dysfunction.</p>
   
    <h3 class="dysfunctions">•	JarajaKlaibya: </h3>
    <p>This type of erectile dysfunction mainly occurs in old-age or due to consumption of anaphrodisiac foods (avrishyaahara). Such conditions cause a decrease in tissue fluids (rasa dhatu). In elderly males, the decrease in the level of testosterone (the main androgenic hormone) leads to a decrease in the production of sperms, which in turn decreases the force of erection and ejaculation.</p>

    <h3 class="dysfunctions">•	Shukrakshayaja Klaibya<sup>2</sup>: </h3>
    <p>According to Charaka, factors like regular consumption of hot and spicy food, psychological factors like anger or depression cause an increase in the vatadosha, which leads to a decrease in the tissue fluids. Subsequently there is progressive loss of all body tissue elements (dhatukshaya), including seminal fluid. </p>

    <h3 class="dysfunctions">What are the symptoms to look out for (Rupa)<sup>5</sup>?  </h3> 
      <p>The symptoms or <span class="hbbold">Rupa</span>  of erectile dysfunction are:</p>
        <ul class="dysfunctions">
          <li>-	Constriction of the penis (MlanaSisnata)</li>
          <li>-	Lack of ejaculation (Nirvirya)</li>
          <li>-	The absence of erection (Dhvajanuccharya)</li>
          <li>-	Inability to perform a sexual act (Suratasaktata) </li>
          <li>-	Profuse sweating (SvinnaGatrata) </li>
          <li>-	The absence of frothy formation in urine</li> 
          <li>-	Swelling, pain and redness of penis</li> 
          <li>-	Ring like hardness in the circumference of the penis</li> 
          <li>- Pain in the pelvis, testicles and groin </li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="dysfunctions">Can erectile dysfunction lead to other problems (Upadrava)?<sup>6</sup> </h3> 
      <p>The following are the complications associated with erectile dysfunction:</p>
        <ul class="dysfunctions">
          <li>-	Low self-esteem </li>

        </ul>

    <h3 class="dysfunctions">Risk factors for Erectile Dysfunction<sup>9</sup>: </h3> 
      <p>The following factors increase the susceptibility to erectile dysfunction:</p>
        <ul class="dysfunctions">

                  <h3 class="dysfunctions">An Ayurvedic guide to Sexual wellness<sup>3</sup>:</h3>
                  <p>Talking about sex has always been a taboo in Indian society. But since ancient days, Ayurvedic science has been providing excellent tips for improving the sexual health of both males and females. </p><br>
                  <p>Ayurveda considers sex and sexual intercourse not only as an activity that gives pleasure but also as one that enhances the emotional bond and mutual respect between both partners. The couple maintain equilibrium and achieve sexual satisfaction in an activity. In Ayurveda, Sex (Kama) is considered to be a valid and legitimate goal of human life.</p><br>
                  <p>One of the most vital aspects of sex in Ayurvedic literature is Shukra. Shukra refers to sperms, ovum, sex hormones and a matter-based potency in every cell. The presence of this Shukra in each cell is responsible for the regeneration of the cells. The food we consume undergoes several levels of metabolic transformation to form Shukra. It is present in our body since birth, but it acts as a major driving force in the body after puberty sets in. </p><br>
                  <p>The Shukra in our reproductive organs is the cause for procreation and that present in other parts of the body becomes responsible for the beauty and sexual attraction in both males and females. This effect of Shukra begins to decrease with the process of ageing.</p>
                  <p>According to Ayurveda, the following sexual cycles are helpful in healthy sexual management:</p>

                  <ul class="dysfunctions">
                      <li>•	Diurnal sexual cycle, practising sex in the nighttime is recommended than during day times.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> •	As the body’s shukra levels begin to deplete according to age, the ideal age to have good sexual activity is in the age between 18 years to 25 years. </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>•	Avoid sex when women are in their periods or active menstrual cycle. This is to avoid the effect of aggravated vata dosha during this phase.</li><br>
                          <li>•	Do not indulge in sex if you are too hungry or thirsty, and immediately after a meal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Ayurveda also recommends the consumption of warm milk after coitus to replenish the lost vigor.</p>
                    
                  </div>
              </div>
      
              <p>Ayurveda focuses on the all-round management of the condition rather than just the symptoms. Ayurvedic treatment, which includes medicines, diet and lifestyle changes, has been very effective in treating sexual disorders like erectile dysfunction without any side effects.  </p>
