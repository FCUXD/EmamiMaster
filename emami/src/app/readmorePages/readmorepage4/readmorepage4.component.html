    <h1>Do you often complain about your liver?</h1>

  <h3>Overview of liver disease:</h3>
  <p>Have you ever heard of grandparents or people of their generation talking about liver problems? Not usually, isnâ€™t it. This is because of the fact that their daily lifestyle, food habits and physical activity levels were all favourable for a healthy liver. But, people of the present generation,
     especially of the urban population, seem to discuss a lot about liver diseases such as jaundice, fatty liver or liver cirrhosis. This is because we have adopted a culture of regular consumption of fast food or habitual drinking, all of which are directly or indirectly damaging the liver and causing various liver diseases. </p>
  <p>Loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, pain in the upper abdomen and generalised weakness are some of the common symptoms of liver diseases. Treatment may range from medications to transplantation of the liver depending on the severity of the condition.<sup>1</sup>  </p>
  <h3>Why is your liver important?<sup>1</sup> </h3>   
  <p>The liver is one of the important visceral (deeper) organs of the body. The liver performs various functions such as:</p>
  <ul class="dysfunctions">
    <li>1.Produces and secretes bile acids that are helpful in the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K.</li>
    <li>2.Filters the blood that comes from the digestive tract before it enters the rest of the body</li>
    <li>3.Detoxifies chemicals and drugs</li>
    <li>4.Removes bilirubin (formed by the breakdown of haemoglobin of the red blood cells) from the blood</li>
  </ul>

              <h3>Liver and Bile juice<sup>1</sup>  </h3>
              <p>Bile is the fluid secreted by the liver and is stored in the gallbladder. It helps in the process of digestion by breaking down fats into fatty acids, which are taken into the blood stream from the digestive system. </p>

     <h3>Aggravated Pitta: The Culprit<sup>2,3</sup>  </h3>
     <p>Pitta dosha is one of the tridosha in the body that is responsible for various metabolic processes such as digestion. It is characterised by fire (Agni), one of the five elements in the body. Aggravation of Pitta results in excessive bile production or a blockage in the bile flow and gives rise to many liver diseases.</p>
     <h3 class="dysfunctions">Types of Liver diseases:<sup>3,4,5</sup> </h3> 
     <p>According to Ayurveda, the following are the different types of liver diseases:</p>
     <h3 class="dysfunctions">Direct diseases (Pratyaksa):<sup>3,4</sup> </h3>
     <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1.Cirrhosis of liver (Yakrddalyudara) </li>
       <li>2.Hepatomegaly (Yakrtvrddhi)</li>
       <li>3.Chronic hepatitis (YakrtgataDosa) </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 class="dysfunctions">Indirect diseases (Apratyaksa) <sup>3,4</sup> </h3>
     <p>These are the diseases which have been well discussed in the Ayurvedic texts but their exact, direct pathological relationship with the liver has not been determined.  </p>
     <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1.Jaundice (Kamala)</li>
       <li>2.Jaundice complicated with Diarrhoea (Panaki)</li>
       <li>3.Jaundice aggravated with Ascites (Kumbha Kamala)</li>
       <li>4.Jaundice complicated with fever (Halimaka)</li>
     </ul>

      <h3>What causes liver problems (Hetu)<sup>3</sup> </h3>
      <p>According to Ayurvedic text the following factors are considered responsible for the occurrence of liver diseases:</p>
     </div>
     <h3 class="dysfunctions">Dietary causes (Aaharaj):</h3>
     <p>Unhealthy eating habits are one of the main reasons for the pressure and damage to the liver. Few of such habits are listed below:</p>
     <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1.Consumption of spicy or heat causing food items (Ushnateekshnaahara)</li>
       <li>2.Eating heavy and hard food items (Guru abhishyandibhojana)</li>
       <li>3.Consuming excessive non-vegetarian food regularly as a part of the daily meal.</li>
       <li>4.Eating uncooked or improperly cooked food (Ama Pakwanna)</li>
     </ul>
     <h3 class="dysfunctions">Habitual causes (Viharaja):</h3>
     <p>Liver problems are mainly caused by lifestyle habits such as:</p>
     <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1.Suppression of natural urges (Vegadharana)</li>
       <li>2.Sleeping during the daytime (Diwaswapna)</li>
       <li>3.Sleep disturbances or waking up in the middle of the night (Ratrijagarana)</li>
       <li>4.Excessive drinking of alcohol (Madyapana)</li>
     </ul>
     <h3 class="dysfunctions">Exogenous factors (Agantujahetu):</h3>
     <p>Some external factors may irritate the liver and cause different types of liver diseases. They are as follows:</p>
     <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1.Injury to the liver (Kshata) during severe road traffic accidents</li>
       <li>2.Infections such as hepatitis</li>
       <li>3.Constant exposure to toxic compounds </li>
       <li>4.Prolonged use of medications containing Acetaminophen, Erythromycin, Diclofenac and Rifampicin.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>According to Ayurveda, the causative factors of the liver disease aggravates the pitta dosha and results in an interruption in the metabolic processes of the body. By-products of metabolic processes are stored in the liver as bile juice, the 
       constituents of which are mainly derived from the metabolism of haemoglobin. This bile juice is considered as the useful by product of the metabolic processes in the body (Dhaturupa mala).<sup>5</sup> </p>
       <p>The aggravated pitta dosha causes an excessive secretion of bile juice. The accumulated bile juice gets converted into harmful products (Kutistha Malas), which needs to be eliminated from the body immediately. If these products are not removed from the body regularly, it gives rise to various liver diseases.<sup>5</sup></p>

              <p>The chronic liver disease also gives rise to these complications:</p>

                    <p>In this test, blood sample are analyzed to check the levels of the following parameters:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>-	Total protein level(albumin+ all other proteins in the blood )</li>
                      <li>-	Albumin, a type of protein produced by liver</li>
                      <li>-	Enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and

                    A liver problem may result in the decreased production of clotting factors, which results in reduced clotting and uncontrolled bleeding.</p>
