  <h3>Are skin problems troubling you? </h3>
  <p>Can you imagine any life on earth without an outer skin? Skin is one of the most important organs that serves as the first line of defence of your body. It protects all your internal organs against every external influence. In addition to that, skin is the largest sense organ that perceives sensations such as pain, touch, pressure and temperature.
     Good skin health implies overall well-being, and contributes to the beauty of an individual. </p>
  <p>The incidence of skin problems has drastically increased in our times owing to faulty eating habits, environmental factors and weak immunity. Some of the common skin diseases, which are highly prevalent among us,
     are acne, dermatitis, eczema and psoriasis. This article deals with skin diseases in general, and mentions of particular diseases wherever appropriate.  </p>
  <h3>Treat skin problems with Ayurveda <sup>1</sup> </h3>   
  <p id="kapha">Ancient Ayurvedic texts have described skin diseases under one broad term known as Kustha<sup>1</sup>. Skin disease may be hereditary in origin or may be acquired due to physical, psychological and social causes. It affects the overall health of an individual.  </p>
  <p>Patients with skin disorders also exhibit psychological disorders such as anxiety or depression. This relationship between skin and mind has been explained by Acharya Charaka as ChetahSamvayi<sup>2</sup>. To treat skin problems, Ayurveda focuses on improving the overall health of an individual i.e both physical and psychological.</p>
  <h3>What causes skin diseases? (Nidana) <sup>2</sup></h3>
  <p>Ayurveda has described many internal and external factors that cause skin diseases. The different etiological factors are as follows:</p>
  <ul class="dysfunctions">
    <li>1. Real or main causative factors <span class="hbbold">(SannikristaNidana):</span> 
        The vitiation of the three doshas in the body - Vata, Pitta and Kapha, and the four dushyas i.e. derangements in the Tvak (Rasa)- essence that nourishes the skin, Rakta(Blood), Mamsa(muscles) and Ambu(channels which regulate water metabolism) affect the skin and give rise to various dermatological disorders.
        </li>
    <li>2. Other factors <span class="hbbold">(ViprakrishtaNidana):</span>  
      These factors do not cause the disease directly, but aggravate the actual disease-causing agents or doshas in the body. They are divided into the following groups:
    <ul class="dysfunctions">
      <li>-	KulajaNidana: These refer to the genetic causes which may give rise to skin diseases. Such diseases are present since birth and are believed to have transmigrated from the past lives. </li>
      <li>-	Janmottarakalaja: These refer to various dietary, lifestyle, and psychological factors which give rise to skin diseases. </li>
    </ul>  
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>People with different body composition are vulnerable to specific skin conditions. </p>
   <p>Let us have a look at the specific causes of skin diseases:</p>

     <h3>Samprapti<sup>2,3</sup></h3>
     <p>According to Acharya Charaka, there are seven dravyas involved in the disease process inside the body. They are Vata, Pitta, Kapha dosha, rakta(blood), mamsa (muscle), tvaka (skin) and lasika (lymphatic fluid). Disease-causing factors (nidana) cause imbalance of the tri- dosha in the body which in turn affect the body tissues (dhatus) and result in the development of skin diseases (Kushtharoga).  </p>
     </div>

     </div>

     <h3 class="dysfunctions">Signs of skin disease to look out for (Rupa)<sup>2,3</sup> </h3>
     <p>The symptoms of skin disease (kushtha) are based on the dosha predominance: </p>
     <span class="h3span">VatajaKustha:</span><span class="pspan"> People with this type of kushtha have skin lesions with the following characteristics:</span>
     <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1. Roughness in the skin</li>
       <li>2. Piercing pain</li>
       <li>3. Hardness </li>
       <li>4. Blackish and reddish skin patches</li>

     </ul>
     <span class="h3span">PittajaKushtha :</span><span class="pspan">Below is a list of characteristics of skin lesions with aggravated pitta dosha:</span>
        <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1. Redness of the skin</li>
       <li>2. Burning sensation</li>
       <li>3. Fleshy smell</li>
       <li>4. Pus discharge</li>
       <li>5. Blister formation</li>
       <li>6. Excessive secretions</li>
     </ul>
     <h3 class="dysfunctions">KaphajaKushtha: </h3>
     <p>The skin lesions with the vitiation of kaphadosha in the body are as follows:</p>
     <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1. Skin becomes cold and dense </li>
       <li>2. Itching </li>

       <li>4. Discolouration</li>

       </ul>
       <p>The prognosis in the individuals with vata-kapha predominant kushtha is benign, as it can be easily treated with ayurvedic treatment.</p>
     <h3>Can skin problems lead to more troubles? (Upadrava)<sup>4</sup></h3>
     <p>Early diagnosis and treatment of Kushtha is essential to avoid the development of complications such as infections (krimi) in the affected areas. The infections may be of a bacterial or fungal type, and give rise to the following symptoms:</p>
     <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1. Formation of skin boils</li>
       <li>2. Excessive thirst and burning</li>

       <li>5. Jock itch</li>
       <li>6. Vaginal infections</li>
     </ul>
    
     <div class="">
        <h3>Diagnosis of Kushtha <sup>5</sup>  </h3>
        <p>The Ayurvedic practitioner observes the doshic composition and notes down a detailed history of the onset of the symptoms, diet pattern and lifestyle. Most of the skin diseases are identified based on the symptoms. But following diagnostic tests may sometimes become necessary.</p>
        <ul class="dysfunctions">
            <li><span class="hbbold">1. Skin biopsy:</span>  In this test, a small section of the skin is excised using a scalpel and then studied under the microscope to identify the exact pathology.</li>
            <li><span class="hbbold">2. KOH preparation:</span>  When a fungal skin infection is suspected, testing with KOH preparation is done. A small sample from the edge of the skin lesion is scraped off and is collected in the microscope slide. 
              It is then treated with potassium hydroxide solution which helps in easier visualisation of the fungus which has caused infection. </li>
            <li><span class="hbbold">3. Tzanck Smear:</span>  This test is to find out herpes virus infection of the skin. The scrapings from the skin lesion is placed on a microscope slide and is stained with Giemsa stain. Multinucleated giant epithelial cells indicate herpes virus or varicella zoster infection. </li>
            <li><span class="hbbold">4. Wood Lamp test:</span>  A wood lamp uses ultraviolet light to diagnose skin conditions for example certain types of tinea capitis, Corynebacterium infection, vitiligo. The various skin conditions exhibit specific colors when viewed under the Woodâ€™s lamp</li>
            <li><span class="hbbold"> 5. Patch test: </span>This test helps to find out sensitivity to specific allergen. In this test, a set of suspected allergens are placed on various section of
               the patientâ€™s skin and allowed to remain in contact for 48 hours. Following this, the allergens are removed, and the skin is evaluated for signs of hypersensitivity. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Treat skin diseases with Ayurveda<sup>1</sup> </h3>
          <p>The main aim of Ayurvedic treatment is to regain the lost doshic balance in the body. Ayurveda focuses on three-fold management of skin diseases:</p>

          <ul class="dysfunctions">
            <li>1. Avoidance of the causative factors <span class="hbbold">(Nidanaparivarjana):</span>  Avoid exposure to the disease-causing agents or allergens.</li>
            <li>2. Pacification <span class="hbbold">(Samshamana):</span>  It is the process of regaining the balance between the three doshas.</li>
            <li>3. Bio-purification <span class="hbbold">(Samshodhana):</span>  It refers to the cleansing of the body with five types of panchakarma. </li>
