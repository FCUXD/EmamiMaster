  <h3>Diabetes in a nutshell:</h3>
  <p>India is globally known for its contribution in Information Technology, Space Technology, Medical Advancements. But it also holds a place in being the diabetes capital of the world.  According to WHO, India harbours the fastest growing population of patients with diabetes. Currently, India represents 49% of the world’s diabetics, with nearly 72.9 million suffering from diabetes. It is estimated that by 2045, about 134.3 million people will be afflicted with diabetes. </p>
  <p>Urbanization, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy food habits have all contributed to this staggering prevalence rate of diabetics in India. Thus, it is also termed as one of the major lifestyle diseases. </p>
    <p>Diabetes, if not treated on time, may lead to life threatening complications such as coronary heart disease, kidney failure, neuropathies, diabetic coma and many more. 
         </p>
     

    <h3>What is diabetes?</h3>
    <p>Diabetes is a disease condition in which the body is unable to effectively convert sugar (glucose) into energy. This leads to accumulation of sugar in the blood (high blood sugar).

              <h3>Carbohydrate – Your body’s fuel</h3>
              <p>The food, that we eat, is broken down into carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrate is converted into glucose, which serves as the fuel for all the metabolic processes in the body. This glucose is taken up by the body cells from the blood and is converted into energy. 
                     </p>
              <p>Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas. This hormone helps the body cells to take up glucose from the blood which is then converted into energy. The secretion of insulin depends on the energy requirements of the body.

     <h3 class="dysfunctions">Diabetes occurs when any of these following dysfunctions happen:</h3> 
     <ul class="dysfunctions">
       <li>1. The pancreas fails to secrete sufficient insulin</li>
       <li>2. The body cells are not responsive to insulin (insulin resistance)</li>
       <li> <p>Both these conditions lead to a decreased uptake of glucose by the cells, thereby causing hyperglycemia (or high blood sugar) and glycosuria (excess sugar in urine).</p></li>

      <h3>Diabetes in Ayurveda </h3>
      <p>Diabetes mellitus has been described in detail in the most well-known Ayurvedic texts, such as Charaka –Samhita, Sushruta-Samhita and Bhrigu-Samhita. Ayurveda describes diabetes under the name of ‘Prameha’. The Prameha is a syndrome that includes clinical conditions involved in obesity, prediabetes, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome.  </p>
     </div>

     <div class="causes">
        <h3>What causes diabetes (Hetu)? </h3>
        <p><b>Diabetes can be classified into two types, based on the cause:</b></p>
        <ul class="dysfunctions">
            <li>1. . Sahaja(Genetic): This type of diabetes runs in families. It occurs at a very young age. Sahaja prameha and Jatah prameha are very similar to type 1 or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Decreased nutrition during important periods of growth in life- fetal life, infancy and childhood – have been known to contribute to type 1 diabetes.</li>
            <li>2. Apathyaja(acquired): This type of diabetes occurs due to factors such as obesity and unhealthy lifestyle. The characteristics of this type is similar to type 2 diabetes mellitus.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b> Causes of Apathyaja ( similar to Type-2):</b></p>
        <ul class="dysfunctions" id="Kapha">
            <li>1. Sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity.</li>
            <li>2. Sleeping for long hours and daytime sleeping.</li>
            <li>3. Excessive consumption of puddings made of sugar and jiggery, flesh of aquatic animals, curds and milk.</li>
          </ul>
     </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h3>Diabetes and the tridosha (three fundamental bodily bio-elements )</h3>
              <p>In Ayurveda, diabetes has been categorized as a type of Prameha which refer to a group of disorders that causes excessive urination and abnormal changes in the characteristics of urine. Prameha is considered to be a Tridoshaja Vyadhi (the disease condition that possesses the psycho physiological principles of all three doshas described in Ayurveda i.e Vata, Kapha and Pitta).  
                     </p>
              <p>Based on the dosha which predominates, prameha is classified as Vataja, Pittaja and Kaphaja prameha. These three types are further divided into 20 subtypes:              
              </p> 
              <ul class="dysfunctions">
                  <li>•	Kaphaja Prameha: This is further divided into 10 subtypes</li>
                  <li>•	Pittaja Prameha: This is further divided into 6 subtypes </li>
                  <li>• Vataja Prameha: This is further divided into 4 subtypes</li>
                </ul>

                     <h3>The Predominant Dosha and the diabetes type</h3>
                     <p>According to Ayurveda, vataja prameha is similar to type 1 diabetes which is hereditary and has no cure. On the other hand, kaphaja prameha is similar to type 2 diabetes which is acquired and is curable. 
                            </p>

            </div> 
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>What happens inside the body? (Samprapti)</h3>
                <p>Prameha is known to start with the aggravation of kapha that spreads all over the body and mixes with meda(fats), which has properties similar to kapha. This kapha-meda mixture passes through the urinary system and interferes with the process of urine formation and elimination. Such interference can also be brought about by deranged vata, pitta combination and other body toxins. This is believed to be the prime reason for excessive urination.
                       </p>
                <p>If not treated on time, aggravation of the doshas can lead to problems in the development of bone marrow, body tissues, nutritional elements (fat, proteins, and carbohydrates), and hormones (ojas). In Ayurveda, Madhumeha is described as a subtype of Vataja Prameha that can occur as the terminal stage of type 2 diabetes, or as type 1 diabetes beginning at early childhood. Defined as Jatah Pramehi  Madhumehino in Charak Samhita, it is said to be an incurable form of Prameha. 
                </p>
                <h3>Know the symptoms before it’s too late (Purvarupa)</h3>
                <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease. This condition is diagnosed late because the chief symptom, such as increased urination, is evident only during the later stages of the disease. According to Ayurveda, the following premonitory symptoms of prediabetes<b>(Purvarupa)</b> become evident due to the aggravation of the doshas: 
                       </p>
                <ul>

                  <li>9. Bees and ants getting attracted to body and urine</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Symptoms of diabetes (Rupa)</h3>
                <p>In addition to the above symptoms, the following signs are seen in patients with diabetes</p>

The treatment plan for a patient is extremely individualized and helps the patient become free of diabetes, healthy (sukhayu), live a long life (deergha jeevanam) and be productive in the society (hitayu).</p>
